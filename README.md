# GateOps – Smart SDLC Coordination Platform

![GateOps banner](./public/architecture_pro.svg)

> **Built by engineers, for engineering teams — GateOps turns process friction into flow.**

---

## ✨ What is GateOps?
GateOps is an enterprise-grade platform that eliminates chaotic chat-based coordination in software projects. By enforcing **branch freeze / unfreeze rules** at the Git layer, it gives QA and Dev teams full control over multi-environment release workflows.

- **Prevent accidental pushes** to critical environments with one click.
- **Multi-VCS support:** Bitbucket, GitLab and GitHub (self-hosted).
- **REST & Webhook API** for seamless CI/CD integration.
- **Role-based access** and **real-time dashboards** for total visibility.

## 🚀 Live Demo
A live instance is deployed on Vercel → <https://gateops-landing-page.vercel.app>
